About me
======
I am Zhongzheng, a fourth-year Ph.D. student at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) (NTU), Singapore. Apart from NTU, I am also affiliated with [I<sup>2</sup>R, A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r) (Singapore’s national research agency) and [Descartes CNRS@CREATE](https://www.cnrsatcreate.cnrs.fr/descartes/) (a French-Singaporean collaborative research programme). I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Xudong Jiang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/exdjiang/) and Dr. [Savitha Ramasamy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SLQ1lxgAAAAJ&hl=en), and was previously co-supervised by Prof. [P.N. Suganthan](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=yZNzBU0AAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research interests lie broadly in **time series analysis**, encompassing tasks such as classification and forecasting. I also explore continual learning, online learning, and multimodal learning in time series contexts. Currently, I am investigating the adaptation of time series foundation models for real-world applications.


Apart from research, I like reading 📚, music 🎵 (playing violin 🎻 sometimes) and doing sports 💪🏀. I’m also a fan of MMA 🥊 and video games 🎮 (though I’ve stopped playing them recently!). But honestly, the thing I enjoy and do the most is hanging out with my friends 🥰.
